## Introduction

Smartphones play a crucial role across personal, business, and various industry sectors, including gaming, healthcare, entertainment, and social media. Their versatile capabilities have made them essential in daily life. Mobile app development can be approached in different ways, from native solutions to cross-platform options. For native Android development, Android Studio and Kotlin are used, while iOS development relies on XCode with Swift. Popular cross-platform solutions include Flutter, React Native, Ionic, and Xamarin.

In native Android app development, there are two main approaches. Jetpack Compose is a modern, declarative framework for building user interfaces, while the traditional approach involves XML-based view creation.

Testing Android apps during development offers several options. Android Studio provides an emulator for in-app testing, though it can be resource-intensive. Alternatively, apps can be tested on a physical device connected via USB or Wi-Fi, offering a more realistic user experience.

## Setup

Install Android Studio (Windows), open any of the two projects, perform the necessary configurations and synchronizations indicated by the application, even if it is necessary to update some packages. Remember to correctly import the projects, both must work in Android context. After the build is successful, you can run the projects without any problem, by clicking “Allow” on the smartphone screens that will appear in the application, and giving “Allow” to the system popup windows.

# Android Development Workshop Series

This repository contains a series of Android development projects, each designed to build hands-on skills with Android Studio, Jetpack Compose, ROOM, and more. Below are the projects included in this repository, with links to their specific documentation.

## Projects

1. [Liquid Payment Calculator App](./fundamentals/README.md)  
   An app that calculates net payments for contractors and regular employees, demonstrating the use of Jetpack Compose and XML Views for UI.

2. [Shopping List App](./persistence/README.md)  
   A shopping list manager that allows users to add, edit, delete, and mark items as purchased, utilizing ROOM for local data persistence and Jetpack Compose for UI.

Each project folder contains a detailed README file with instructions and requirements for building and running the application.
